This is a simple hack to allow pfsense captive portal user creation,
without requring hacks to the pfsense core itself, or admin / root 
access to the pfsense box. Basically one just runs another small 
lighttpd process (since everything is already setup and installed) 
and access the $config variable found in /etc/inc/config.inc and
write_config() function found in /etc/inc/functions.inc. The
current incarnation of this tool generates 10 random user/pass
combos and sets an expiry date, based on whatever day of the month
it is 48 hours after creation. 

By visiting the prune.php page one can remove all accounts 
that have expired, this can also be called by cron easily. 
Please note there is a known bug where frequent calls to prune.php 
are required until all accounts have been cleared up, I have no 
idea why it's only doing a few accounts at a time, but for now repeat 
until the string "Nothing to prune.\n" is found. 

Please make sure to bind this to your STAFF interface, so that 
only staff may generate accounts. 


SETUP 

Create a new directory for www files. 
mkdir /var/www

Copy files to new directory. 
cp *.php /var/www/

Edit lighty.conf to set bind address and port.
vi lighty.conf

Run lighttpd
lighttpd -D -f lighty.conf

Visit IP in lighty.conf default: http://10.0.0.254:90/
To prune, prune manually from command line: php -f prune.php 
or visit http://10.0.0.254:90/prune.php
 
More instructions for setting up as daemon coming soon.
